<mark id="mark"> Birth and Baptism </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Mother Euphrasia was born on 17<sup>th</sup> October 1877 in the ancient Catholic family of Eluvathingal Cherpukaran Anthony and Kunjethy in the Kattur village of Edathuruthy parish. Her father was well known, as a wealthy man of determination and power. Her mother was a virtuous woman, daughter of Chalissery Ittikuru Porinchu of Aranattukara. The eldest child was christened by the Vicar, Rev. Fr. Mathew Ukken in the Edathuruthy Parish Church on October 25<sup>th</sup>, the eight day of her birth and was named ‘Rosa’, the name of her paternal grandmother according to tradition. The couple had three more sons and a daughter.

<mark id="mark"> Rosa’s Early Life </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Rosa fully inherited the parental virtues and she was blessed with certain inborn qualities of her own. Stubborn and short-tempered at times like her father, she insisted on obtaining whatever she wanted. Her mother Kunjethy was simple, unassuming and docile, though she also came from a wealthy and prestigious family. She was extremely calm and composed with a deep spirit of prayer and great devotion to the Mother of God. Rosa received this precious treasure from her mother – a spirit of prayer and deep devotion to the Blessed Mother. This genuine, loving and prayerful family atmosphere was greatly conducive to the spiritual growth of young Rosa who grew up with great zeal and fervent desire to love God and offer herself totally to Him.
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> The divine call </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Rosa was fortunately blessed with the rare joy of offering herself to Lord Jesus Christ. She had offered her virginity forever to the Lord and desired to become the bride of Christ. But her father wanted to marry her off to a very wealthy family which would add to his prestige. In her confrontation with her father, Rosa said: “I want to become a nun”. Her father was furious and said that he would never allow Rosa to be a nun. If it is necessary the younger girl Kochuthresia could go. This did not pacify Rosa. To add to the confusion Kochuthresia fell ill and died soon. The little girl was buried in the parish cemetery. This made Anthony think again and worried whether God will take even Rosa away. Broken hearted, he agreed to Rosa’s desire.

<mark id="mark"> In the Boarding of the Carmelite Sisters </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> On October 24<sup>th</sup> 1888, Anthony took his daughter to the Boarding house in Koonammavu, run by the Carmelite sisters, specially intended for training those who desire religious life. The Carmelite Convent in Koonammavu was the first indigenous Convent in Kerala founded by Blessed Chavara Kuriakose Elias and Fr. Leopold Beccaro, the Italian Carmelite Missionary. Rosa was very happy there as she found all that she was desiring for, prayer life, fervent love of God and joyful community life. The well-disciplined prayer life in the Boarding made Rosa feel that she was in second heaven. Prayer was given priority there as Rosa did in her life.
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> Education </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Rosa had the rudiments of education from the local Asans (tutors) in Kattur which was the custom at that time. In the Koonammavu Boarding, the girls were taught Tamil, Malayalam, English, Mathematics and Music. Besides, they were given training in needlework, drawing and handicrafts like making flowers, rosaries, etc. Rosa had a special talent in needlework and drawing. Her handwriting was beautiful, although she was not very smart in her studies.
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> Trials </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Rosa’s life was full of trials and she tried hard to overcome them. There were times when Rosa would have been sent back home for treatment and improvement of health as she fell too often a victim to ill health. She was very much grieved when the authorities said that she did not have the health to stay in the Boarding. She was afraid whether she would be sent back home. Her only solace at such times was the Immaculate Mother. She prayed to the Blessed Virgin with much confidence and trust. “Mother, am I not your daughter? Permit me to become a member of your Congregation and consummate my sacrifice”. She stood close to that maternal heart and Mother Mary took her in her charge and protected her like the apple of her eye.

<mark id="mark"> Sickness </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> In 1889, in the month of September, Rosa had an attack of rheumatism and her frail body was exhausted and she lost the lustre of her eyes. Treatment was in vain according to expert medical opinion, but it was not possible to send her home for lack of proper conveyance. As her condition grew worse, the nuns arranged to administer ‘Viaticum’ to her, when they found her sinking. Then, as all of them fixed their eyes upon her, there came a strange incredible change. Rosa’s pale little face suddenly beamed up with life, and beauty. Her eyes got back the lustre and her face became extremely beautiful and joyful. She stretched out her arms as if she was receiving somebody very dear to her. The onlookers were startled as she got up and sat showing perfectly regained health. Rosa had only a smile to offer as the nuns surrounded her with queries. But she could not escape from the Superior. Rosa explained how she had the vision of the Holy Family – Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and how she was told that she would definitely have a long period of life as a nun before she would embrace death. The Superior was prudent enough to note down all the details and when Rosa went over to the Convent in her own diocese in 1897; this note was also sent to Bishop John Menachery, the Bishop of Trichur. There was also an added note by the Superior: “Before this event happened it had been decided to send her home without allowing her to join the Convent. Because of this event and also because of this child’s modesty, devotion and well-disciplined life, it was decided to accept her in the Convent”.

<mark id="mark"> Mother Superior </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Sister Euphrasia was appointed in 1913 as Mother Superior of the Ollur St. Mary’s Convent. From the very beginning Mother Euphrasia entrusted her administrative task to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She first of all installed a beautiful statue of Sacred Heart of Jesus in the central part of the Convent. Mother Euphrasia began and ended her day before this Sacred Heart. As she passed that way, she would look at it with utmost love. After 10.30 in the night, when the chapel doors were closed, Mother Euphrasia would stand before the Sacred Heart Statue that she installed and pray and converse with the Lord for a long time. Even after midnight the sisters, who had got up in the night, had seen her praying before the Sacred Heart statue. Even today with a graceful look and an open heart that statue is there. Everyone in the Convent goes there and prays as the sisters pass there. Now this place is turned into Euphrasian Museum and all people who come here pray with great devotion.
