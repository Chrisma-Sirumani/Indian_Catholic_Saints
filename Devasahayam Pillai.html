<mark id="mark"> Early life </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Neelakandan Pillai was born into an affluent Hindu Nair family in Nattalam in the present-day Kanyakumari District on 23 April 1712. His father, Vasudevan Namboodiri, who was a Namboodiri Brahmin from Kayamkulam in present-day Kerala state, was a priest at the Adikesava Perumal Temple in Thiruvattar, in present-day Kanyakumari district of neighbouring Tamil Nadu. Neelakandan's mother, Devaki Amma, hailed from Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari District. In accordance with the tradition of the Nairs of the day, his biological father had no role in his upbringing as he was a outcaste child born to a Brahmin father and a non-Brahmin woman: Neelakandan was raised by his mother and her eldest brother.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Neelakandan's family had much influence in the royal palace of Maharaja Marthanda Varma, king of Travancore and went into the service of the royal palace as a young man. His capabilities and enthusiasm did not go unnoticed in the palace, as he was soon put in charge of state affairs as an official under Ramayyan Dalawa, the Dewan of Travancore.
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> Conversion to Christianity </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> In 1741, Captain Eustachius De Lannoy, a Dutch naval commander, was sent on command of a naval expedition by the Dutch East India Company with the objective of capturing and establishing a trading port at Colachel, a port under the control of Travancore. In the ensuing Battle of Colachel, fought between the Travancore forces and the Dutch, the Dutch were defeated. De Lannoy's men were either killed or captured. Eustachius De Lannoy and his assistant Donadi surrendered and were imprisoned.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> De Lannoy and the Dutchmen were later pardoned by the king, on condition that they serve in the Travancore army. In the course of time, De Lannoy earned the trust of the king and went on to become the commander of the Travancore army, the very forces that had earlier defeated him. He trained the Travancore forces on European lines and introduced new weaponry and gunpowder. As military commander, he won many battles for Travancore, resulting in the annexation of various neighbouring territories to Travancore.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> It was during their influential roles under the King of Travancore that Devasahayam Pillai and De Lannoy became well acquainted. De Lannoy's Christian faith interested Devasahayam ; thus, De Lannoy enlightened him on the faith, leading to Devasahayam Pillai's conversion in 1745. At this point, he took the name "Devasahayam" ("help of God"), which is the translation into Malayalam of the name 'Lazarus.'
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> Baptism </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> On Devasahayam's acceptance of the Christian faith, he was baptized at the Roman Catholic sub-parish church at the Vadakkankulam village (in the present-day Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu), where the Jesuits had a mission under the Rev. Fr. R. Bouttari Italus S.J. Neelakanda Pillai, his name at birth, was then changed to "Lazar", although he is more widely known by the Tamil and Malayalam translation Devasahayam (meaning God's help). Pillai was married by this time to Bhargavi Ammal from Kunchu Veedu, Elanthavilai, Mayicode in Travancore State. She was baptised alongside her husband as a matter of course. She was given the baptismal name "Gnanapoo Ammaal" ("Flower of Knowledge", equivalent to Theresa in Tamil and Malayalam). Fearing reprisal in her native Travancore against her religious conversion, she chose to become a migrant-resident of Vadakkankulam village. Some other members of Devasahayam Pillai's immediate family also later received baptism.
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> Orders based on accusations and charges </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Church chroniclers say that the Brahmin chief priest of the kingdom, the feudal lords, members of the royal household and the Nair community brought false charges on Devasahayam to the Dewan, Ramayyan Dalawa. The allegations were leaving Hinduism and stop following Hindu beliefs. Leaving Hinduism was a great offence. Pillai was divested of his portfolio in the Travancore administration and was arrested. He remained in prison for three years, during which time the king of Travancore came under tremendous pressure from the Europeans seeking his release. Orders were finally passed for him to go into exile. He was initially ordered to be seated backward on a buffalo (a public humiliation) and paraded to the Kuzhumaikkad border, where he would be released and could enter into Dutch-controlled territory (or citadel/fortress used for trade and shipping). The original Royal order was later altered, and Devasahayam was taken on the back of a buffalo to Aralvaimozhy border (much closer to the capital, Padmanabhapuram), where he was tortured by ten different karyakkars (Royal officers), on the advice of the ministers, before being released into a mountainous forest area, on the other side of which was the kingdom of the Pandya kings, traditional rivals of Travancore.
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> Other traditions and beliefs </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Devasahayam Pillai was marched from Padmanabhapuram Palace to Aralvaimozhy by soldiers, over the period of a few days. Pillai was treated like a criminal and as was customary in those days for criminals, his body was painted with red and black spots, and was intentionally marched through populated areas, sitting backward on top of a water buffalo (the mythical vehicle or vahana of Yama, the lord of death in Hinduism) through the streets of South Travancore. As a method of torture, he was beaten every day with eighty stripes, pepper rubbed in his wounds and nostrils, exposed to the sun, and given only stagnant water to drink.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> While halting at Puliyoorkurichi, not far away from the Padmanabhapuram Palace of the Travancore king, God quenched his thirst by letting water gush through a small hole on a rock, on the very place where he knelt to pray. The water hole is still found in the compound of a church at Puliyoorkurichi, about 15 km from Nagercoil.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> It is also believed that the leaves of a neem (Margosa) tree in the village of Peruvilai, to which he had been tied while being marched to Aralvaimozhy, cured illnesses of sick people in the village and around. Many more miracles are attributed to Devasahayam Pillai.
</p>
<pre style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:35; color:#FF007D">
<mark id="mark"> Death </mark>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> In 1752, the original order of the King and his Dewan was to deport him from Travancore, into the Pandya country, at Aralvaimozhy. He was let off in the forested hills near Aralvaimozhy. There, begun deep meditations, and the people from the adjacent villages began visiting the holy man. At this time, high caste Hindus plotted to do away with Devasahayam.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Soldiers went up the forested hills and tried to shoot Devasahayam, but were unable to fire; after which he took the gun in his hands, blessed it and gave it back to the soldiers to shoot him to death, if they wished to. The soldiers took the gun back and fired at him five times. His body was then carelessly thrown out near the foothills at Kattadimalai.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> It was at Kattadimalai in Kanyakumari district that Devasahayam Pillai died on 14 January 1752. Pillai's body was later recovered by some people of the region and carried to the church at Kottar, in present-day Nagercoil. His mortal remains were interred near the altar inside St. Xavier's Church, Kottar, Nagercoil, which is now the diocesan Cathedral.
</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<p style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:25; color:#FF007D"> Since the days of the interment of the mortal remains of Devasahayam Pillai, many Christian pilgrims have visited his tomb and offered prayers.
